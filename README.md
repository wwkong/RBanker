*README and General Information for RBanker*
================================


Project Overview
================================

Back when I was an intern at a financial consulting firm, I had this idea of finding a way of scraping and analyzing personal banking information from online banking services via scripts. Unfortunately for me, the only data analysis tool that I had at my disposal at the time was a weak knowledge of HTML pages, VBA, and some intermediate Excel functions.

Today, I plan to bring this project back to life using my current favourite data mining tool, R. For now, I am only planning to do some simple scraping and analysis on TD's EasyWeb service but depending on how the project goes, more features and online banking systems may be added.

Recommended R Packages
================================

If anyone wishes to fork this project and contribute, you will probably need the following packages:

* RCurl
* XML

I will try to update this list as more features are added.

Completed Features
================================

None at the moment...

Features to be Implemented

* TD Bank Login Script
* XML Table Data Scraper
* Table to R Data Frame Parser

Future Additional Features

* Graphical and Spatial Analysis via R data packages
* Option to export to an Excel-friendly file
